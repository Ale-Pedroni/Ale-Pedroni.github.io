Summary: How the quest to find the source of the world's longest river led explorers to Uganda

In 1862, British explorer John Hanning Speke made a discovery that would end centuries of speculation and debate: he identified Lake Victoria in Uganda as the primary source of the Nile River. This revelation solved one of geography's greatest mysteries that had puzzled minds since the time of ancient Egypt.

Standing at Ripon Falls near Jinja (now submerged beneath the Owen Falls Dam), Speke declared he had found the long-sought "source of the Nile." This announcement wasn't without controversy, as his fellow explorer Richard Burton disagreed with his conclusion. Their public disagreement led to one of the most famous debates in the history of exploration.

Today, Jinja proudly calls itself the "Adventure Capital of East Africa," offering white-water rafting and other activities at what is recognized as the point where the world's longest river begins its 4,132-mile journey to the Mediterranean Sea. A monument near the source commemorates Speke's historic discovery, marking Uganda's special place in the story of one of humanity's oldest geographical quests.

# Welcome to Our Brutalist Website

This is a sample article that demonstrates the styling of our brutalist website, inspired by the colors of the Ugandan flag.

## What is Brutalism in Web Design?

Brutalism in web design is characterized by:

- Raw, unpolished aesthetics
- Exposed structure and functionality
- Bold typography and high contrast
- Minimal styling and animations
- Rejection of conventional design principles

Brutalist websites prioritize content over aesthetic appeal, embracing a raw and unfiltered approach to design.

## The Ugandan Flag Color Palette

The Ugandan flag consists of:

1. **Black** (#000000): Representing the African people
2. **Yellow/Gold** (#FCDC04): Symbolizing sunshine and vitality
3. **Red** (#D90000): Representing brotherhood and the blood that unites all Africans

We've extended this palette with additional colors that complement the flag's vibrant scheme:

- **Deep Maroon** (#8C0303): A darker shade of the flag's red
- **Light Gold** (#FFE866): A lighter version of the flag's yellow
- **Dark Charcoal** (#333333): A softer black for text
- **Off-White** (#F5F5F5): For backgrounds and contrast
- **Forest Green** (#006633): Representing Uganda's lush landscapes

## Code Example

Here's a simple Python function that generates the colors of the Ugandan flag:

```python
def ugandan_flag_colors():
    """Return the primary colors of the Ugandan flag."""
    colors = {
        "black": "#000000",
        "yellow": "#FCDC04",
        "red": "#D90000"
    }
    return colors

# Get the colors
flag_colors = ugandan_flag_colors()
print(f"The colors of the Ugandan flag are: {', '.join(flag_colors.keys())}")
```
